# invariants  

**Scope:** Architectural invariants.  
**Audience:** Contributors.  
**Guarantees:** Invariants map to tests.  
**Non-Goals:** Rationale narrative.  
Why: This doc exists to record its single responsibility for review.  

## Overview  
This doc defines one responsibility.  
Architecture components are defined in [Architecture](architecture.md).  
Read [Docs Style](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md) before edits.  
Read [Triage](../meta/TRIAGE.md) for context.  

## Contracts  
Each statement is a contract.  
Contracts align with [tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py).  
Contracts link to [Docs Style](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md) and [Triage](../meta/TRIAGE.md).  

## Invariants  
Invariants describe stable behavior.  
Checks align with [tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py).  
Invariants align with [Docs Style](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md).  

## Failure Modes  
Failures are explicit and tested.  
Failure coverage aligns with [tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py).  
Failures align with [Triage](../meta/TRIAGE.md).  

## Extension Points  
Extensions require tests and docs.  
Extensions are tracked in [Docs Style](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md).  
Extensions align with [tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/regression/test_architecture_invariants.py).  

## Exit Criteria  
This doc becomes obsolete when the surface ends.  
The replacement is linked in [Triage](../meta/TRIAGE.md).  
Obsolete docs are removed.
