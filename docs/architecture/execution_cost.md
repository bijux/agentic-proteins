# execution_cost  

**Scope:** Canonical execution cost per tick.  
**Audience:** Contributors and reviewers.  
**Guarantees:** Cost fields are defined and recorded.  
**Non-Goals:** Benchmark optimization.  
Why: This doc exists to record its single responsibility for review.  

## Overview  
This doc defines canonical execution cost.  
Architecture components are defined in [Architecture](architecture.md).  
Read [Docs Style](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md) for structure.  

## Contracts  
CPU time is recorded per tick.  
Memory usage is recorded per tick.  
Agent count and signal volume are recorded per tick.  

## Invariants  
Cost records are appended per step.  
Cost fields are numeric and non-negative.  
Cost recording does not mutate state.  

## Failure Modes  
Missing cost records fail tests.  
Negative values fail validation.  
Inconsistent ticks fail review.  

## Extension Points  
Cost changes update [Metrics](metrics.md).  
Stress tests update [Pathway Limits](pathway_limits.md).  
Documentation updates follow [Triage](../meta/TRIAGE.md).  

## Exit Criteria  
This doc becomes obsolete when costs are generated.  
The replacement is [Metrics](metrics.md).  
Obsolete docs are removed.
