Threats: - Conceptual drift in core definitions. - LLM overreach beyond regulator bounds. - Performance regression under load. - Reviewer misinterpretation of claims. Abuse cases: - Path traversal via candidate IDs. - Crafted sequence inputs to bypass validation. - Unauthorized resume requests for stale runs. Resource risks: - Large batch runs exhaust disk. - Oversized sequences exhaust memory. - High-rate API requests saturate CPU. Assumptions: - Local filesystem permissions prevent cross-tenant access. - Providers return deterministic results for fixed inputs. - CI artifacts are not tampered with between steps.  </p>"}]}
